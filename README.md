# KeyWordArc: Intelligent Information Retrieval System

KeyWordArc is an efficient information retrieval system designed to store, organize, and retrieve keywords and their associated articles. The system leverages a Binary Search Tree (BST) for seamless data management and ensures optimal performance when handling large datasets.

## Features
- **Efficient Data Management**: Organizes keywords dynamically using a Binary Search Tree for quick and reliable access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides traversal modes (in-order and pre-order) and intelligent search functionality to simplify access to stored information.
- **Scalable and High-Performance**: Built using Java with robust file-handling mechanisms to support large datasets and ensure reliability.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: Reads article metadata (ID, title, author, and keywords) from a file (`datafile.txt`) and indexes the keywords in a Binary Search Tree.
2. **Keyword Management**: Links each keyword to its associated articles for structured retrieval.
3. **User Interaction**: Offers menu-driven options for keyword traversal, article details retrieval, and targeted keyword search.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (Version 17.0.10 LTS)
- **Data Structures**: Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **File I/O**: Java FileReader and BufferedReader
- **User Interface**: Console-based interaction with menu-driven options

## Applications
KeyWordArc is ideal for:
- Managing academic repositories
- Indexing digital library content
- Handling large-scale keyword-based datasets
